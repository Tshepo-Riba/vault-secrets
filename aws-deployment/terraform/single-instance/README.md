## Deploying with Terraform:
1.Initialize Terraform:
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```
2. Apply the Configuration:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```
This will prompt for the necessary variable inputs such as key_name, vault_ami_id, vpc_id, and subnet_id.

## Post-Deployment:
After the instance is deployed, you can access the Vault UI by navigating to http://<vault_instance_public_ip>:8200 in your browser.
